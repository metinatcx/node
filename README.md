# HTML-and-CSS-for-beginners

## Introduction

Welcome to my repo, focused on pure HTML and CSS. Here you can play with HTML and CSS to create a simple page, allowing you to practise with the foundations of coding and web development. This is about easing your way into the world of code and programming, for those who have little to no experience.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language and stands for hyper text mark up language. It is what web developers use to display text and websites on a computer screen. A computer reads the language and uses it like a set of instructions on how a particular page should be displayed. 

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for cascading style sheet and allows you to add style, colors, boarders and many other visually appealing features to your web page and HTML document. 

## How to contribute

- Fork the repository
- Clone the repository to your own account
- Create a new branch for your changes
- Edit the index.html file or style sheet with your own code
- Keep one new feature per new commit
- Commit your changes on the command line / terminal
- Push the changes to your repository on GitHub
- Submit a Pull Request to have your changes contributed to the main repo

Fork the repo to your own account, then clone the repository to your own computer. It is best practise to create your changes on your own branch, which I will merge with the maste if successful. From there, edit the files, adding one new feature per commit to the webpage or styling - be imaginative, and use code and syntax that you are new to, push yourself out of your comfort zone. Try new things.

## Aims

The aim here is to allow those who are new to computer code and web development, to come together and practise their skills and newly aquired understanding in a friendly, judge-free environment. Here, we are all beginners. I will help and offer advice to those submitting pull requests or those with questions. 

Contributing here will also allow your GitHub profile to appear more engaging, and is perfect for those starting out in using GitHub and making contributions. 

## Any questions?
Let me know if there are issues, with the files or code, or with other users, or anything! I want to support the community and engage actively in broadening the scope. 

### This is just the beginning...
